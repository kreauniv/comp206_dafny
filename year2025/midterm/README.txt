Instructions
============

1. Each question appears in a separate file named "qn.c0" where n 
   is the question number. There are 4 questions totaling to 
   50 points which will be scaled down to 20 points towards the
   course total.

2. The question appears as a comment at the top of the file.
   The rest of the file has placeholder functions for you
   to fill. 

3. The files are expected to be compilable using the command
   "make" run within the directory containing the source files.
   Running the "make" command will produce an executable file
   named "program" which you can run using "./program".
   Whenever you change any source file and you wish to run it
   to test it out, you can run "make" to produce the program
   and run it. As a shorthand, you can also type "make run".
   Once your work is complete and you want to submit, run
   "make submission" and a file named "midterm.tar.gz" will
   be generated in the parent directory. You can submit that
   file. Do not modify the Makefile.

4. You may use the provided main.c0 for your tests. This file
   is not part of the submission. You may do whatever you want
   within this. By default it calls the test functions declared
   in each module.

6. DO NOT modify the file names of the questions.

7. DO NOT modify the names of the functions you're expected to fill out.
   You'll need to put in your code wherever you see a "// TODO:" marker.
   You're also required to write the loop invariants for loops that you
   create .. even if only trivial ones exist. If you have test functions 
   that check properties that are typically checked by contracts, they may
   count towards your score in lieu of contracts, but stick to
   the given function stubs for basic contracts.

8. Any additional functions you add that are used by your code are ok.
   You will need to add the appropriate #use directives at the top 
   depending on what you need to use.

9. Normal plagiarism checks apply. So feel free to discuss with your
   classmates, but implement the code on your own.

10. Please use appropriate indentation to make your code readable.

11. Do place explanatory comments where you see necessary.

12. There is a utility file named "utils.c0" which contains a couple of
    approximate integer functions that you can use in your complexity
    calculations.
